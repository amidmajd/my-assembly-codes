# My Assembly Codes
* These are some Assembly Projects that I coded for my assembly course in university
* These Assembly codes are specific for AVR microcontrollers
* The Simulation you see in some images are Proteus Design Suite application

**PS** : My actual code files got lost because of a system failure and these images are the
only remainders of them.
